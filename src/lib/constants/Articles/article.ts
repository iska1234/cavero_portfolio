        summary: 'Selecting the right front-end framework is, in fact, a significantly important part of web development. In the year 2024, quality web apps will be dependent on the right front-end framework, and plenty of options with innovative features will be available. This blog will analyze the best front-end frameworks for web development in 2024.\n\nThe front-end frameworks have revolutionized the approach of how web developers design and implement user interfaces with a simplified and structured process of developing websites.\n\nThis is one of the factors that led to the development of front-end frameworks as web applications grew more complex with more mobile and animated features. \n\nIn the early days of the Web, web pages were rather simple; they mainly featured static HTML with minimal interactivity. But when the demand for real-time, live web applications grew, developers faced some difficulties in handling the complexities of the front-end codebase.\n\n Initial front-end frameworks like jQuery tried to deploy DOM manipulations and introduced a more efficient way of controlling web animations. However, with the increase in web application complexity, the need for a more defined and scalable approach emerged. \n\nDevelopers today have different language tools, such as HTML, CSS and Javascript, to design more interactive user interfaces. The incorporation of such tools helps developers come up with robust and useful applications that meet the requirements of users in 2024 and beyond.',

        summary: 'First things first, a quick introduction on what is React. It is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It has changed the front-end development landscape ever since it came out. So, if you are aspiring to be a front-end web developer learning libraries like React or Vue.js is almost essential in today`s industry. Here is a great tutorial if you`re just starting to learn React. https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html.\n\nI remember when I started learning React. I always had the anxious feeling that I could never learn everything I needed to, the ever-changing JavaScript language looming over my head, and if I ever did get something right, I would always end up asking myself, was it really the best way to do it? After literally hundreds of online tutorials, Youtube searches, and unfinished (and most likely unwashed) cups of coffee, I finally had a firm grasp of what React tries to bring into the JavaScript table.\n\nHowever, I have always struggled to find a tutorial that bundles all the advanced concepts of React into one compact tutorial.\n\nAlso, I remember having a hard time understanding these concepts when they were used inside a big source code. That is the gap that this article is trying to fill. Advanced tools and concepts are embedded into our simple app, this is solely for tutorial purposes and you shouldn`t use these concepts if your app doesn`t need them.\n\nEnough with the chit-chat. Let`s talk code. Download the finished code from this repo and follow the README so you can see and feel what we are going to build here. https://github.com/jelorivera08/react-starter-pack.',

This helps us format the state/data that we receive from the redux state tree and by doing this, we save a lot of time coding new functions that handle state restructuring or formatting the target state every time we need it to render something in the front-end. In this example, I didn`t alter the state that I received.

                content_4: 'Solid is a declarative Javascript library used to build user interfaces. It does not use a Virtual DOM; rather, it compiles its templates to real DOM nodes and updates them with fine-grained reactions.\n\nSolid is an active library that focuses on deep, granular reactivity intended to provide great performance and reactivity without resorting to virtual DOM or batching.\n\nSolid proxies make it such that subscriptions are hidden within the function that shows its value. This makes elements consuming the signals become the invocated contexts. Solid supports the different state management libraries by providing several ways to implement different patterns. Solid is the preferred choice for projects that require high-resolution reactivity.',

                content_5: 'Qwik is a new kind of web framework that can deliver instant loading of web applications of any size or complexity.\n\nThe unique part of Qwik is not in what it does but in how it achieves its goals. Qwik focuses on having instant-on applications, especially on mobile devices.\n\nQwik achieves this by delaying the download and execution of Javascript until it is necessary; this way, Qwik web apps start fast because there is very minimal code required for the start-up.\n\nAlso, the Qwik front-end framework has the reusability feature, which enables web apps to continue execution where the server left off.\n\nThis is achieved through data serialization into HTML strings so that after the movement from server to browser, the execution can simply continue from where the server stopped, thus eliminating the issue of data duplication.',

                content_6: 'Preact is a lightweight and performance-enhanced alternative to React that provides the same API and feature set.\n\nHowever, the major advantages of Preact are a virtual DOM, component-based architecture and server-side rendering. First of all, Preact is a great tool for developing smaller to moderately-sized applications which perform above the average mark. These include mobile apps and e-commerce.\n\nPreact is well-suited to projects in which you seek high performance and small app size. It is also among the best front-end frameworks that are ideal to apply when you are making web applications for environments with limited resources.',

Angular is also very good at building complex and large-scale applications.\n\nIt is the most preferred choice for enterprise-level projects because of its two-way data binding, dependency injection and very comprehensive command-line interface (CLI). Applications such as Google Cloud, Microsoft Office Online, and IBM Cloud use Angular.\n\nIts strength is in its performance of complex workflows and data tasking, making it a beast in the front-end development world. The backwards compatibility of the framework allows existing projects to move smoothly while reflecting modern web development trends.',
